       <h2>My Motivation to Becoming a Frontend Developer</h2>
        <p>
          From a young age, I have always been captivated by the world of
          technology. As a curious boy, I often found myself dismantling
          computers and gadgets around my childhood home, driven by a relentless
          desire to understand how things worked. This passion for computing
          ignited a lifelong journey of exploration and learning in the tech
          field. </p>

        experiences.  
        The combination of design and technology excites me, as
        it allows me to transform ideas into interactive websites and
